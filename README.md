# Helm Charts Repository

[![Workflow](https://github.com/fminna/mycharts/actions/workflows/worflow.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fminna/mycharts/actions/workflows/worflow.yaml)

This repository contains a list of Helm Charts publicly available. Each folder (e.g., busybox-pod) represents a Chart.

This is a real-world example of storing Helm Charts in Github Pages, as described in the [Learning Helm](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-helm/9781492083641/) book.
